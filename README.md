# KindScaler: Node Management for KinD Clusters

KinD is a solution that allows to quickly create local Kubernetes clusters, ideal for development or testing tasks. However, once these clusters are created, KinD does not have built-in features to modify the cluster configuration by adding or removing nodes, whether they are control-planes or workers, and the entire cluster would need to be regenerated from scratch.

KindScaler comes to facilitate this task. After dissecting how KinD creates and adds different nodes and roles to the cluster, this bash script has been created and allows to add both workers and control planes.

# How-to

```
./kindscaler.sh <clustername> -r <control-plane|worker> -c <count>
```

For example, adding 3 workers to cluster `kind`:

```sh
$kind create cluster --config cluster.yaml
Creating cluster "kind" ...

 âœ“ Starting control-plane ðŸ•¹
 âœ“ Installing CNI ðŸ”Œ
 âœ“ Installing StorageClass ðŸ’¾

Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"

You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

## Deleting nodes

```sh
kubectl delete node <nodename>
docker stop <container>
docker container rm <container>
```
